Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
﻿
Basic Permissions
The Program may be used only for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may not use the Program in commercial activities or participate in any competitive event involving the use of the Program.
You may not distribute or sublicense the Program for commercial purposes or competitions.
You are free to make, run, and propagate modified versions of the Program for your personal use.
No Commercial Use
Commercial use of the Program, including selling or offering the Program in any way for profit, is not allowed under this License.
You may not use the Program to compete in any contests or competitions where the result involves monetary reward or commercial benefit.
Other Rights and Conditions
You retain the right to modify the Program for personal use, and you may convey modifications to others, provided the modifications are not used for commercial purposes or competitions.
You must continue to adhere to the rest of the AGPL terms, including providing the source code to recipients of any modified version.

﻿
This revision modifies the permissions to ensure the Program is only used for non-commercial and personal educational purposes, and explicitly prohibits its use in competitive contexts. All other conditions regarding distribution, modification, and source code availability remain intact.
